#### My dotfiles for Linux. ####
Running Xubuntu (courtesy of [HugeGreenBug](https://github.com/hugegreenbug) on
an Acer C720 with an added 128GB SSD.

These dotfiles are managed using the wonderful GNU Stow.

#### How to get started: ####
1. Make a directory "dotfiles" in your home directory and clone this repo there
2. While in ./dotfiles/, run stow 'package name' (ex. stow vim, stow bash etc.)
3. ???
4. Profit!

Clone and enjoy!
