#### My dotfiles for Linux. ####
Running Xubuntu (courtesy of [HugeGreenBug](https://github.com/hugegreenbug) on
an Acer C720 with an added 128GB SSD.

These dotfiles are managed with GNU Stow.

#### How to get started: ####
1. Clone and toss files in ./dotfiles
2. Run stow 'package name' (ex. stow vim, stow bash etc.) (Make sure you have
   Stow installed on your system.)
3. ???
4. Profit!

I may add more of my dotfiles here as time goes on. Feel free to clone and 
enjoy!
