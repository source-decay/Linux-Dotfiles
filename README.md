#### My dotfiles for Linux. ####
Running GalliumOS on an Acer C720 Chromebook with an added 128GB SSD

These dotfiles are being managed using GNU Stow. Make sure you go grab it.

#### How to get started: ####
1. Make a `dotfiles` directory in your home directory
2. From inside `dotfiles` run `stow _package name_` (for example, _stow vim_)
3. Stow will automagically place appropriate symlinks where they will be looked for while keeping the actual dotfiles
in `dotfiles/`
4. ???
5. Profit

Clone and enjoy!
